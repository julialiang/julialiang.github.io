				<p> During the summer of 2015, I had the incredible opportunity of interning at <a href="http://highwaytwenty.com/">Highway Twenty</a>, a digital marketing agency for non-profits. Highway Twenty works on causes that matter to the Phoenix community. The agency boasts some of the most creative, thoughtful, and quick-witted #girlboses I've ever met, and of course, is fueled by Lola coffee. </p>
				<p>As the Front-End Development & Design Intern, I QA'd for and resolved inconsistencies in styling and user experience issues on three website for both desktop and mobile devices. I designed print collateral, social media graphics for multichannel content marketing campaign (optimized and sized for various social media platforms), and PDF downloads for a lead generation campaign.</p>

						<h2 class="project-title">Southwest Human Development</h2>
						<p>Southwest Human Development is the largest early childhood development nonprofit in Arizona. At Highway Twenty, I had the pleasure of participating in the complete redesign and development of their new website. </p>
						<p>When I joined this project, several people had transferred content onto the website without a clear methodology. My job was to implement a consistency in content population and a clear typographic hierarchy across the 200 pages of this website. I QA'd the site several times for consistent image, link, and button styling, and I developed the sidebar. </p>
						<p>Through the development of this site, I learned how to populate content on WordPress, configure plug-ins, and change theme settings. One of the largest tasks for this website was to ensure compatibility across all devices. At every point in the development process, I consciously considered the scaling and stacking mandatory for mobile-friendliness. I wrote many, many media queries, particularly for the homepage and footer, maintaining the same typographic hierarchy and readability of the desktop site.</p>
						<p>Aside from the coding, one of the most important skills I gained from this project was the ability to communicate development updates and needs to the client. Please note that even though I made design decisions, I do not intend to take credit for entirety of the design or development of this website.</p>

						<h2 class="project-title">MovePHX</h2>
						<p>MovePHX is proposition and transportation plan to expand light rail and bus service and repair aging streets in Phoenix. When I jumped in to work on this project, much of development had been completed, but the content was missing from the internal pages. I transferred the content from our client into the site, made a few design decisions, and implemented a type hierarchy.</p>
						<p>When most of the development had been completed, I QA'd the site across digital devices and fixed issues in styling, particularly in mobile. As simple as it sounds, from this project, I learned to decipher and delve into code written by another developer.</p>

						<h2 class="project-title">NorthBridge</h2>
						<p>NorthBridge College Succes program provides support, resources, and guidance to students with learning differences as they transition beyond high school. With the goal of increasing enrollment in NorthBridge's program, Highway Twenty conducted a lead generation campaign, and I created the majority of the designed pieces.</p>
						<p>My work on this project includes creating 8 graphics, which were all compatible for NorthBridge's blog, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. These graphics were then converted into advertisements and boosted posts on Facebook. I learned how to design and size graphics for all different platforms and advertising on those platforms. </p>
						<p>Another project I worked on for NorthBridge was designing workbook/guide PDFs for parents of students with learning differences as well as the students themselves. The goal of the guides was to provide a resource for parents and students to digest information about college options and pick the right one for the student. By the end of designing the social graphics and guides, I had developed a set of icons and modernized the brand while staying true to Northbridge's guidelines.</p>
						<p>Towards the end of my work with this client, I developed a list of UX and design issues with their existing website and thought about ways to refresh the site while sticking to their WordPress theme. I learned to extract extraneous information, think about content flow, and make the site more accessable to the user. </p>
